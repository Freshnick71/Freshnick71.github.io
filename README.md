<h1> Who is Bishop? </h1>

<p> When you first hear this word you think of the chess piece that moves diagonally across the chessboard or even a religious leader but I'm talking about a different bishop. I'm talking about the high school senior from University Prep Charter high school. A student who has overcome challenges that were presented in from of him and has continually strived for excellence. </p><
