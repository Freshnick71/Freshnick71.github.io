<h1> Who is Bishop? </h1>

<p> When you first hear this word you think of the chess piece that moves diagonally across the chessboard or even a religious leader but I'm talking about a different bishop. I'm talking about the high school senior from University Prep Charter high school. A student who has overcome challenges that were presented in from of him and have continually strived for excellence. Bishop is currently 17 years old. Born in Lagos, Nigeria. He moved to the United States of America in 2017 and has ever since assimilated to the American culture and societal norms. This 6 feet tall young man loves playing soccer, coding with different programming languages, traveling, reading, dogs and cats, trying out new things, and turtleneck sweaters. He has a dream to one day make an impact in his society and solve the current issues that continue to trouble many people today. He can't wait to graduate from high school and begin a new chapter in his life as a young adult.</p>
